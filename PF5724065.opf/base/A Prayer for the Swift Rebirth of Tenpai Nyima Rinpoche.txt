Oṃ svasti!

Lord of sages, together with hosts of arhats, yidam deities and ḍākinīs,

Great holder of the Early Translation teachings, both kama and terma,
dzinpé drakpa chok su yowé pal
Glorious one, whose renown extends in every direction,

To bring delight to the lotus-like ears of your devoted followers,
trulpé nyima si dir lar jön sol
May your sun-like rebirth return to this realm once again!

möpé bu la tsewé jinlab dang
Through the excellent interdependence of your dance-like display,
dungwé dro la kyobpé rol gar gyi
Which lovingly inspires devoted disciples and protects the afflicted,
tenjung lekpö tenpé nyima yi
May the exceptional good fortune of your return

As a true sun of the teachings swiftly come to pass!

In response to a request from Thupten Thinley, a tulku from Dungri Monastery and the nephew
of this master who has passed into quiescence, Tupten Nyima, who holds the name of a Zenkar
rebirth, wrote this in Shenzhen on 15th June, 2018. May virtue and goodness flourish! Maṅgalam.
