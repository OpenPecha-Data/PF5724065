Prayer for the Long Life of Alak Zenkar Rinpoche
by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche

om svasti, rabjam tselha gyatsö jin tü lé
Oṃ Svasti! Through the power and blessings of an infinite ocean of long-life deities,
khyentsé yeshe dorjé sipé gar
May the life of this emanation of Khyentse Yeshe Dorje,
tubten nyimé tsenchen shyabzung ten
The one named ‘Sun of the Buddha’s Teachings’, Thubten Nyima,
ten dror menpé shyé dön yongdrub shok
Remain secure, and may all his aspirations for the benefit of the teachings and beings be fulfilled.

According to the requests of Sogyal Rinpoche and the Rigpa Saṅgha in Lerab Ling, made together
with the support of an offering, and out of my own feelings of devotion and inspiration,
I, the one named Ngawang Chökyi Lodrö, who bears only the outward signs of a buddhist monk,
made this aspiration and wrote it down on the 6th day of the 10th month of the Wood Bird
year (7th December 2005). Jayantu!
