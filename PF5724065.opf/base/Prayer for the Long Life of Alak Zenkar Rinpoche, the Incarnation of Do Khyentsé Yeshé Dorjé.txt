Long Life Prayer for Alak Zenkar Rinpoche
by Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche

On those occasions when it is not possible to recite the full long life prayer, or when you
are accumulating a number of prayers, recite as follows:
sang ngak rik ngak zung ngak nam sum gyi
Holder of secret, vidyā, and dhāraṇī mantras,
ngak rikdzin pa zen kar trulpé ku
Thubten Nyima, incarnation of ‘the master in the white shawl’1,
tubten nyima özer tong denpa
Sun of the Buddha’s Teaching, with your thousands of brilliant rays,
dé sum yi kyi kha la tak char shying
Always keep rising in the sky of our minds, that have the three kinds of faith,
nyam tak dro kün nyingjé kyongwa dang
Inspiring us to care for suffering beings everywhere with compassion,
rinchen nam sum depé chöpa sok
And to make offerings to the Three Jewels in devotion,
pendé nangwé petsal rab shyé né
So that the shining flowers of benefit and happiness burst into full bloom,
tartuk nyimé yéshe ku tob shok
And ultimately, we attain the body of non-dual wisdom.

Pray like this, and the aim of the prayer will be fully accomplished.

that he wore the white (kar) shawl (zen) of a yogi
