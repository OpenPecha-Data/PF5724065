Tupten Trinlé Pal—'Glorious Enlightened Action for the Sage’s Teachings'—to you I pray.

künkhyab mishik nyingpo dakpé ku
Although the pure kāya, the indestructible essence, is all-pervasive,
ösal rangjung dewa chenpö ngö
Clear light, naturally arising, the actual nature of great bliss,
shek jön tröpé tsenma namdral yang
And is beyond the conceptual characteristics of departing and returning,
tsenpé zukkü gyutrul lar jön sol
Still, I pray you may return in an illusory rūpakāya with all the signs and marks of perfection.

lungtok yönten nyidé kyilkhor né
From the qualities of scriptural learning and realization, like the maṇḍalas of sun and moon,
shedrub nangwé tubten ling shyi khyön
Your teaching and practice illuminate the Buddha’s teaching throughout the four continents,
rabsal ten drö palgön da dralwa
Magnificent and incomparable protector of the teachings and beings,
palden lamé yangtrul nyur jön shok
Glorious guru, may your emanation swiftly reappear!

In the Great Perfection’s clear light of awareness and emptiness,
lhündrub nam shyi drebu ngön jepé
The four visions, the most secret essence of the paths,
ösal riktong dzogpachenpö ten
Manifest the fourfold results of spontaneous presence:
dzin la drenmé yangtrul nyur jön sol
Peerless holder of these teachings, may your emanation swiftly reappear!

palden chok sum gyukar trengwé zi
Resplendent amidst the constellation of the glorious Three Supreme Ones,
zakché zakmé lek jé bum gyi tü
Through the power of a hundred thousand positive deeds, tainted and untainted,
tsungmé lamé yangtrul dawé shyal
May we swiftly have the good fortune to encounter
nyurdu jalwé kalzang ngöngyur chik
The moon-like face of this incomparable guru’s emanation!

As the auspicious interdependent condition for the swift return of an emanation of this incomparable
lord of refuge and root guru, Dodrupchen Rinpoche, and in response to a request from
the community at his seat of Dodrup Monastery in Sikkim, the one called Tudeng Nima, who
holds the name of a disciple of this sole refuge and lord of the maṇḍala and who was the
lowest of his devoted subjects, made this prayer in Hong Kong on the twenty-sixth day of
the eleventh month of the Iron Ox year (28 January 2022). May virtue abound!
