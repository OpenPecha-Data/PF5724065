Long Life Prayer for Patrick Gaffney (Yeshé Wangyal)
by Alak Zenkar Rinpoche

pa tayepé tsé dang yeshe kyi
May the assembly of powerful and victorious wish-fulfilling deities,
chok jin yishyin wanggyal lhatsok kyi
Who grant the supreme gifts of boundless life and wisdom,
chimé tsé yi ngödrub malüpa
Bestow all the attainments of longevity and immortality,
trikchak gyün michepar tsal du sol
In a continuous and everlasting stream, we pray!

In response to the persistent requests of my kindly neighbour Nina-la, who asked me to write
a prayer for the long life of the esteemed Patrick Gaffney (Yeshé Wangyal-la), this was composed
by Thubten Nyima (Alak Zenkar Rinpoche). May Lord Amitāyus grant his blessings so
that circumstances are favourable for this prayer of ours to be fulfilled.
